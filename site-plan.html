        Last-Mag Studios is an indipendent game development studio with focus on making unique VR experiences. It is headed by lead game director and programmer, Aiden Kelley, a student of computer science in Brigham Young University Idaho. Our mission is to show people things they haven't seen before, and listen to the community, our players are our biggest priority. We have seen enough of generic VR games that all feel to to the same thing with small variation, here we want to earn our player by making experiences that are rare or even unheard of in the VR community.

      <h3>Games</h3>
      <p>
         As of now, Last-Mag Studios' first game is on steam and can be wishlisted. Nightmare Labyrinth is an asymetric VR title with a horror twist. A VR player must navigate several distinct mazes with differing tools to help them along their journey, and a desktop/controller player must impede their progress by any means necessary, namely by finding them and capturing them. Nightmare Labyrinth is a fresh look at the VR horror genre and adds new depth and replayability with several distinct levels to play in. Plus, the inclusion of a second player makes it perfect for parties and showing VR to your friends!
